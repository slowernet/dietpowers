name: review
description: Runs a hostile review of a spec, plan, or code in a fresh subagent, then fixes what holds. Use when a spec, a plan, or implemented code needs review before the next step; also when asked to review code, hunt for bugs, audit a diff or branch, stress-test a PR before merging, or "tear this apart"; or to resume a paused review.
argument-hint: "[spec, plan, or code]"

# Adversarial Review

A reviewer that has not seen this conversation judges the work itself, not the reasoning that produced it. A reviewer will always find something, so a review ends when nothing blocking is open, not when the findings run out.

Ask your partner one question at a time, in plain text; do not use the AskUserQuestion tool, because some clients show only the tool's question and drop the text around it. Put what your partner needs to answer in the same message: the problem and why it matters, then the options, recommended first, each with a one-line reason. End with a line naming the answers, such as `Reply with a, b, or c.`, and make the question the last thing in the message, after any tool use. Your partner may answer with an option, their own alternative, a question or an aside. Keep messages short: lead with the decision, then only the detail needed to answer it.

Commits follow two rules. Fixes in a code review follow the code-step rule: commit on the feature branch as you go; if you are on `main`, `master` or the plan's `Base:` branch, first ask once: "I'll create branch `<name>` for this work. Reply with yes or no.", and do no code work until a branch is agreed. Fixes in a spec or plan review follow the document rule: check the plan's `Commits:` line or your partner's earlier answer, and if neither settles it, ask once: "I'll work on branch `<name>`. May I commit the spec and plan to it as we go? Nothing is pushed or merged without asking. Reply with yes or no." Whatever the answer, move the work to that branch; never commit to `main` or `master`. If your partner declines, leave spec and plan edits on disk; the `dietpowers:finish-branch` skill proposes those commits at the end.

Record the review in a tracker, following `## Working directory` and `## Tracker format` in `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/trackers.md`; replies to your questions follow its `## Replies`.

0. If your partner asked to resume, follow `## Resuming` in `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/trackers.md`, then carry on from the step it leads to.
1. Pick the prompt file for the target from this skill's directory, `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}`: `spec-reviewer.md` for a spec (needs `SPEC_FILE_PATH`), `plan-reviewer.md` for a plan (`PLAN_FILE_PATH`, `SPEC_FILE_PATH`), `code-reviewer.md` for code (`SPEC_AND_PLAN_PATHS` or a one-paragraph `REQUIREMENTS`, and `BASE_SHA=$(git merge-base HEAD <base>)`, with `<base>` from the plan's `Base:` line, or ask). Do not read the prompt file yourself. The reviewer grades each finding.
2. Save all work to disk, and commit it: code always, a spec or plan if commits are approved. The reviewer reads the files on disk and git history, never this conversation.
3. Dispatch a `general-purpose` subagent whose whole prompt is: "Read `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/<prompt file>` and follow it," then the placeholder values. Run it on the same model as this session, and wait for its report before doing anything else. Send nothing else: never your session history, never a pasted diff.
4. Create the tracker with `Second pass: pending`, and write every finding into it at once as an unchecked `open` item, so none is lost if the session ends. Then check each finding against the files and record the evidence under Verified.
5. Decide which findings go to your partner.
   - A minor finding that holds and has one reasonable fix: mark it `fix` and tell your partner in one line, the finding and why it holds. Do not wait for a reply.
   - Every blocker and major finding, and any finding you want to reject, downgrade, or fix in more than one reasonable way, or whose fix changes the approved spec (in a spec review, the approved design): ask your partner, one at a time, most severe first. Offer options from fix as proposed, another fix, defer, won't fix and reject, recommended first, and end with `Reply with <options>, or pause.` Record the question under the item's Question before you ask.
   - You may raise a grade on your own; lower one only by asking.
6. Fix once no item is `open`. For code, first record `FIX_BASE=$(git rev-parse HEAD)` in the tracker if it has none, so the fix check sees every fix even when this step runs again. Fix the `fix` items, most severe first. For code, start each fix with a test that reproduces the finding and fails, then make it pass, and commit it. A spec or plan under review is edited directly, and committed if commits are approved. When a fix to a plan or code would alter behavior the approved spec describes, invoke the `dietpowers:update-spec` skill before making it. Mark each item `fixed` with what changed and the commit. If a fix cannot be made, set the item back to `open` with the evidence (what you tried, the failing output) and ask your partner about it.
7. Second pass. If nothing was fixed, set `Second pass: not run (nothing fixed)`. Otherwise dispatch one fix check the same way as step 3, reusing the tracker's reviewer values and adding `FINDINGS` (each fixed item's finding and fix) and, for code, `FIX_BASE`. Never send the tracker. When the report arrives, write all its findings as `open` review-2 items and set `Second pass: done (N findings)` in the same write. Handle them as in steps 4 to 6, with two differences: a finding that matches an item in this tracker is marked `duplicate of N` and not asked unless it brings new evidence, in which case show the earlier decision with it; and for a finding under `Out of scope`, recommend defer unless it is a blocker. If the fix check fails or returns nothing usable, report it and set `Second pass: not run (<reason>)`. Never dispatch another review.
8. Report to your partner, leading with the outcome: what was fixed, deferred, marked won't fix and rejected, each with its reason, and anything still open. Nothing is appended to the spec or plan; the tracker is the record.

Terminal state: the review is done when no blocker or major item is `open` or `fix`. Ask whether to continue, recommending it only when no blocker or major item is `deferred` either, and end the question with `Reply with continue, revise, or stop.`
- After a spec: "Continue with write-plan?" On yes, invoke the `dietpowers:write-plan` skill.
- After a plan: "Continue with execute-plan?" On yes, invoke the `dietpowers:execute-plan` skill.
- After code: "Continue to finishing?" On yes, invoke the `dietpowers:prove-done` skill.

If your partner chooses to revise, make the changes and run this skill again on the revised work, as a new run with a new tracker. If they choose to stop, report what is on disk and what is uncommitted, and stop.
